## Overview

![Preview Image](src/assets/img/board.png?raw=true)

> This trainer works to improve memorization and recall of a chessboard's
> layout & coordinate system, which in turn leads to greater comfort
> reading algebraic notation, an essential skill in game analysis.

## Rules
> When playing as white, the eight "files" - or columns - are labeled
> **A-H (left to right)**, while the eight "ranks" - or rows - are
> labeled **1-8 (bottom to top)**.
> When playing as black, the inverse orientation is true. You'll be
> shown one random coordinate at a time, and your job is to click
> on its corresponding square.
> Each game lasts 30 seconds, and tallies your correct answers.
> Enjoy!
